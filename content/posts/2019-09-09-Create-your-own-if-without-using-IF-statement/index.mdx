So, today I am going to show you a little `simple tip` of writing if statement without using if statement in a shorter way.. It's an short, simple and coolest version of `IF statement`.

>This can help you clean up your code a little bit, making it easier for the eye.

Lets see the code how we write `if statement` while writing code ??

```javascript
	if(condition){
		//block of code to be executed if the condition is true
	}
```

## So Now See the Shortest way of writing if statement 

Basically you just have to follow this structure - (some condition) && (some instructions) - for example:  someVar > someOtherVar && console.log('yeah') This will log 'yeah' if someVar is bigger than someOtherVar.

In this example we just create two if statements, one with the traditional method and the other with this one, to check if 'someString' is truthy. As we can see, both cases are logged on the console.
