So, today I am going to show you a little `simple tip` of writing if statement without using if statement in a shorter way.. It's an short, simple and coolest version of `IF statement`.

>This can help you clean up your code a little bit, making it easier for the eye.

### Let's see how if statement works?
The `if` statement evaluates the test expression inside the parenthesis `()`.
-   If the test expression is `true`, statements inside the body of  `if`  are executed.
-   If the test expression is `false`, statements inside the body of  `if`  are not executed.

Lets see the code how we write `if statement` while writing code ??

```javascript
	if(condition){
		//block of code to be executed if the condition is true
	}
```
### Now look toward's && operator
The `&&` operator are also known  as `logical AND operator`.  Evaluates operands from left to right. `&&` operator find the first falsy value.

-   for each operand or case, `&&` operator convert it into boolean. if the output is `false`, its stop exectution and return the last operand value.
-   If all operand or case is `true`, return last operand.
```javascript
//if the first operand is true,
//return second operand

alert( 1 && 3 ); // 3

//if the first operand is falsy,
//return first false value,
//and ignore left operands

alert( null && 2 ); // null
```
