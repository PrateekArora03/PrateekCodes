excerpt: Getting start with javascript as a beginner
---

Learning JavaScript is like learning any language like English, Hindi, Spanish, etc. But the difference between both is JavaScript is a programming language, and English is a communication language. It means javascript is a way to communicate with the computer, whereas English is a language to communicate with a human to convey a message.

So. let's start learning JavaScript with these points

-   What is JavaScript?
-   What can you do with JavaScript?
-   Where does the JavaScript code run?
-   Difference between JavaScript and ECMAScript?

**JavaScript** is a client-side programming language, which means you can directly run the javascript code on the client or user's browser. It means you don't need to install any third-party software - Just Chrome, Firefox, Opera is enough to execute JS code.

JavaScript can update and change both HTML and CSS. The primary purpose of JavaScript can calculate, manipulate, and validate data.
